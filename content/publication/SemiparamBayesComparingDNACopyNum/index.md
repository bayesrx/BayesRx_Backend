# Abstract.
abstract = "We propose a two-step method for the analysis of copy number data. We first define the partitions of genome aberrations and conditional on the partitions we introduce a semiparametric Bayesian model for the analysis of multiple samples from patients with different subtypes of a disease. While the biological interest is to identify regions of differential copy numbers across disease subtypes, our model also includes sample-specific random effects that account for copy number alterations between different samples in the same disease subtype. We model the subtype and sample-specific effects using a random effects mixture model. The subtypeâ€™s main effects are characterized by a mixture distribution whose components are assigned Dirichlet process priors. The performance of the proposed model is examined using simulated data as well as a breast cancer genomic data set."
