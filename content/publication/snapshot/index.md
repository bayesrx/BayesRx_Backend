# Abstract.
abstract = "Our current and future research efforts have four main themes shown as four quadrants above. The first is developing Bayesian hierarchical models for multi-platform genomics and imaging data for mechanims and biomarker discovery (top left); Bayesian high-dimensional graphical/netwrok models (top right); development of scalable software for reproducibilty and visualization (bottom left -- also see software section) and finally implement these tools in a clinical/translational setting (bottom right). The data sets that feed into these efforts are shown in the corners [see some selected publications below] "
